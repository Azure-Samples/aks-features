## Introduction

## Challenges

Azure Monitor Workspace for Prometheus is a new service (in preview).
It is not yet supported with ARM template or with Terraform resource.

So, we'll use `azapi` terraform provider to create the Monitor Workspace for Prometheus.

And we'll use a `local-exec` to run a command line to configure AKS with Prometheus.

AKS, Grafana and Log Analytics are suported with ARM templates and Terraform.

## Deploying the resources using Terraform

To deploy the Terraform configuration files, run the following commands:

```sh
terraform init

terraform plan -out tfplan

terraform apply tfplan
```

## Cleanup resources

To delete the creates resources, run the following command:

```sh
terraform destroy
```
